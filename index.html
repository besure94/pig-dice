			<h2>Let's play a game!</h2>
			<p>Each player takes turns to roll the dice as many times as they wish. The result of each roll will be added to a running total for each player. If the player rolls a 1, their gained score for their turn will be lost.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the other players turn.
				</li>
				<li>If the player rolls a number other than 1, it is added to their turn total and the player can continue rolling.
				</li>
				<li>If the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the other players turn.
				</li>
